 <p><font color=#78dce8>aavia saniya$</font> <font color = #a9dc76> project-background</font><blockquote><font color = #ff6188>>> I was asked to re-design a e-commerce website for their upcoming beta testing launch. This needed to be created using an online e-commerce platform called Shopify. I focused my efforts on the homepage, making it aesthetic and appealing to new and old customers. Aavia is a smart pill case and application that helps improve your pill-taking habits. Their website was functional however, the UX design was not appealing to the customer and had too much information on one page instead of a set of pages. I wanted to highlight the important information and give users a navigation that would help them find the information they needed right away. While doing all these, I wanted to make sure customers understood the beta/early access for the upcoming product was launching so they could sign up easily.</font></blockquote></p>
 <p><font color=#78dce8>aavia saniya$</font> <font color = #a9dc76> research</font><blockquote><font color = #ff6188>>> The brand: At first, I needed to better understand Aavia and what it wanted to focus on in terms of design and audience. It was important to understand: what type of users use Aavia, how they learn of Aavia, how they usually keep track of their birth control. Then figuring out a user friendly and aesthetic design with Aavia's current branding guidelines. Once the UX designs were given feedback and worked on, then I could research into the implementation of this design into their Shopify website using Liquid.  </font></blockquote>
<blockquote><font color = #ff6188>>> Surveys: Aavia also wanted to better understand what people were interested in their brand. A survey was launched for people requesting early access of their product. Marketing was also a huge focus for Aavia - who wanted to get the word out about the upcoming beta launch and the referral program. I found ways to incorporate this using MailChimp, Shopify, and other APIs using the information from these surveys. </font></blockquote></p>
